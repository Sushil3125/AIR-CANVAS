<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Screenshot (16)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72722093/156774218-b5856dd8-491c-487f-8e38-ca9018b7a0bc.png)

Air Canvas, a project built in python, is a computer vision project using Mediapipe which is a 
cross-platform framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipeline. 
Computer Vision is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems 
to derive meaningful information from digital image, video and other visual inputs- and take 
action or recommendation based on that information.
Air Canvas provides a white canvas in which one can draw without physically touching any 
input devices. Yes you read it right. Air Canvas does not require any physical contact with 
input devices in order to draw on the canvas. Using the power of computer vision and deep 
learning, one can interact with canvas using the tip of his/her finger. All user need to do is 
show their hand in front of the web camera. It detects the palm of user and tracks 21 different 
landmarks in it. Using the tip of the pointing finger one can interact within the canvas.

## AIM OF BUILDING THIS PROJECT

Aim of building this project is to make the virtual classes effective and easy for teachers who 
are facing difficulties drawing/ writing from the mouse and they donâ€™t have either touch 
screen laptop or any other pen input devices. They can simply draw on the board using the 
web cam and tip of their finger, no additional hardware is required.
